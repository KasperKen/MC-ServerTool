# MCservertool

Note - This script requires Python 3 to run. If you would rather use Python 2 you can find the origional script here - https://github.com/techfighterminal/minecraft-server-script. The script is unfinnished and no longer supported however and may not function as intended (or at all).

This is a rewrite of script my friends and I worked on a while back from python 2 into python 3. I've elected to write the code from scratch rather than fork it because the code is frankly an unreadable mess and this allows me to change the license. If you are interested you can find the origional projects repo here - https://github.com/nonprofitgibi/pythonappautomation

Thanks to Fredrich Paulin, and Tanner Gibson for their work on the origional project

This script simplifies setting up a Minecraft server by automating the following tasks

1. Downloads either Minecrafts Vannillia server software or alternative Spigot server
2. Downloads and initializes java installation if appropriate
3. Assists the user in configuring Server.Properties, Ops, and Whitelist files
4. Downloading popular plugins based on user preference if applicable
