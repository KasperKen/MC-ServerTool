I've elected to write the code from scratch rather than fork it because the code is frankly an unreadable mess and this allows me to change the license. If you are interested you can find the origional projects repo here - https://github.com/nonprofitgibi/pythonappautomation\r\n\r\nThanks to Fredrich Paulin, and Tanner Gibson for their work on the origional project\r\n\r\nThis script simplifies setting up a Minecraft server by automating the following tasks\r\n\r\n1. Downloads either Minecrafts Vannillia server software or alternative Spigot server\r\n2. Downloads and initializes java installation if appropriate\r\n3. Assists the user in configuring Server.Properties, Ops, and Whitelist files\r\n4. Downloading popular plugins based on user preference if applicable\r\n\r\n",
